# Inspiration
Exercising is one of the many elements to a balanced and healthy lifestyle, especially in our profession as some of us tend to slack in it. We want XRSZE to make you get off your butt and do things!

# What it does
XRSZE counts your reps for various exercises while keeping you accountable for your fitness goals. We also have an AI Chatbot (made using Groq) that can give you a specialized meal plan, workout routine and even motivation for your specific height, weight, age and dietary restrictions!

# How we built it
We built XRSZE using various web technologies and APIs. The front-end interface was designed with HTML/CSS/JS for simplistic beauty. For the backend, we used Node.JS and integrated it with MediaPipe for the Computer Vision and movement tracking while using the Groq API for the Chabot. We fine-tuned our Groq AI Chatbot to specifically work greatly with fitness and food consumption and to give advice to improve your health. We also specifically calibrated the MediaPipe recognition model to detect accurate body movements to count and recognize workouts and count/time the activities accurately.
